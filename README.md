# Baby Blockchain : A blockchain network in JavaScript
## Overview and purpose of the system / product
This is a blockchain that illustrates the basic principles of the functioning of blockchain technology. 
It is an implementation of my own minimal version of the blockchain (without decentralization and consensus, only basic mechanics).
## System Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you've installed it right if you can run:
    - `git --version`
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
  - This is a browser extension that lets you interact with the blockchain.
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - You'll know you've installed nodejs right if you can run:
    - `node --version` And get an ouput like: `vx.x.x`
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) instead of `npm`
  - You'll know you've installed yarn right if you can run:
    - `yarn --version` And get an output like: `x.x.x`
    - You might need to install it with npm

## Features
 - A blockchain
 - Hashing
 - Transactions
 - Accounts
 - Signatures

 ## Interaction
 This will be updated as I continue to work on the project.
